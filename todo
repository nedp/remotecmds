1. Reformat declaration comments to be full sentences...
    "X takes a Y and does Z."

2. Change empty slice declarations to
    `var t []string`
    instead of
    `t := []string{}`
    because it's more memory efficient.

3. Change error messages to phrases instead of sentences.
    (start lowercase, no ending punctuation)
